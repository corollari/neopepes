# NeoPepes 

An interactive tutorial on Neo smart contracts.

## Acknowledgements

This project was originally developed by Neuti Noel Yoo (@neutiyoo) as a guide on writing Scilla, we modified the content and some of the form in order to transform it into NeoPepes, but we've only been able to do this thanks to him for creating it in the first place and making it open source :)
